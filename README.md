DNA Sequence Property Calculator
Overview

The DNA Sequence Property Calculator is a simple Python-based project that calculates basic biological properties of a DNA sequence using fundamental programming logic.
This project is designed for beginners who want to understand how biological data can be analyzed without using advanced bioinformatics libraries.

The focus of this project is clarity, correctness, and biological understanding rather than complex tools.


What This Project Does

This tool analyzes a DNA sequence and calculates:

Total length of the DNA sequence

Count of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C)

GC percentage

AT percentage

Validation of the DNA sequence (only A, T, G, C allowed)


Tools Used

Python (basic level)

No external bioinformatics libraries
